      <h3>About the KyKirin Reading Series</h3>
      <img class="center" src="Kykirin logo.svg" alt="Kirin logo">

      <p>&quot;The Legend of KyKirin&quot; is the partner story to “The Legend of Phinnie,” the pilot
      story of the Phinnie Reading Series. Phinnie, the Magic Dolphin, was born in the South
      China Sea a long time ago on a starry night when the moon was full. On his first leap,
      the dolphin went so high that he was kissed by the moon. The moon, enchanted by the
      silvery pink dolphin, left an indelible mark on the left side of his body and endowed him
      with magic powers. Among the many special gifts, the moon gave the dolphin eternal
      youth. And this was how the story of Phinnie, the Magic Dolphin, began….</p>

      <p>He spent his early years on the beach playing with the children and being their
      friend. But those happy days did not last long. In time, the blessing of eternal youth
      became a curse. He was forever losing his friends who grew old and died.</p>

      <p>One day, saddened by his own loneliness and disappointment of those around
      him who always wanted more in the fish-eat-fish world, he left the South China Sea to
      travel around the world to meet new friends and to learn about life. Phinnie&#39;s fisherman
      friend taught him many lessons in life.</p>

      <p>Phinnie also had the good fortune of making friends with KyKirin, the legendary
      creature much besought by man. The two became the best of friends. KyKirin, blessed
      by the sun, also taught Phinnie many secrets of life.</p>

      <p>The two best friends continue to tell stories to the children of the world. As
      Phinnie traveled, he observed and listened, and soon his repertoire of stories gained him
      international fame as a storyteller. At the same time, KyKirin continues to entertain
      Chinese children from the world by providing them with stories based on Chinese culture
      and Chinese folk legends. Through these stories, KyKirin helps Chinese children to learn
      about Chinese customs and culture. KyKirin also heard many fables told by Aesop, the
      storyteller from ancient Greece. KyKirin was fascinated by Aesop’s fables, which he likes
      to retell to Chinese children because they reflect many of the beliefs of Chinese culture
      and of human nature in general. Together, Phinnie and KyKirin continue to entertain the
      children of the world… When you visit Ma Wan, you can sit in one of the two pavilions
      and listen to their stories. As you look out to sea, the Kirin Rock is on the left and the
      Phinnie statue is on the right. And if you let your imagination run wild, you will be able
      to see the single silvery horn on the Kirin Rock sparkling in the sun.</p>
