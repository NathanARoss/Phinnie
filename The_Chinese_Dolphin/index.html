      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>The Chinese white dolphins have often appeared in groups off the southeast shore of Ma Wan in the South China Sea, inspiring storytellers to weave interesting stories on Hong Kong, China, and faraway lands.  Although estimates vary, it is generally believed that about 1,000 Chinese white dolphins live in the estuary of the Pearl River.  The most extraordinary fact about these dolphins is that some of them are pink.  Usually the calves are grey until they grow bigger and their skin lightens and some turn pink.</p>
